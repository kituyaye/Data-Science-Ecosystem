# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem Summary

## Overview

This notebook, **`DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`**, was created for course assignment for "Creating and sharing a Jupyter Notebook" part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It provides a summary of the essential tools, languages, and concepts within the Data Science ecosystem.

## Notebook Objectives

The primary goals demonstrated and summarized in this notebook include:

* Listing popular languages for Data Science.
* Identifying commonly used libraries in Data Science.
* Listing open-source development environment tools.
* Showcasing basic arithmetic expression evaluation in Python.
* Performing simple unit conversions (minutes to hours) using code.

## Key Content Sections

The following elements are covered within the notebook's markdown and code cells:

### 1. Data Science Languages
An ordered list of common languages, such as:
1.  Python
2.  R
3.  SQL
4.  Julia

### 2. Data Science Libraries
An ordered list of popular libraries, including:
1.  Pandas
2.  NumPy
3.  Matplotlib
4.  Scikit-learn

### 3. Development Tools
A single-column table summarizing key open-source development environments:
| Data Science Tools |
|--------------------|
| Jupyter Notebooks  |
| RStudio            |
| VS Code  |

### 4. Code Execution Examples
The notebook contains two executed code cells demonstrating Python's capabilities:
* A cell to evaluate the expression **`(3*4)+5`**.
* A cell to convert **`200 minutes`** to hours.
